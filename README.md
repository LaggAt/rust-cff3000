Rust cff3000
============

The Rust `cff3000` can be used to work control a GPIO connected
Abus CFF300 remote control. The crate provides methods to lock,
unlock or query the CFA3000 state.

Examples
========

```rust
extern crate cff3000;
use cff3000::CFF3000;
use std::io::{Error,ErrorKind};

fn execute(cmd: &str) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let cff3000 = try!(CFF3000::new("/dev/gpiochip2", [2,3,4,5]));
    let duration: u8;

    match cmd {
        "lock" => {try!(cff3000.lock()); duration = 10;},
        "unlock" => {try!(cff3000.unlock()); duration = 10;},
        "check" => {try!(cff3000.check()); duration = 8;},
        _ => return Err(Error::new(ErrorKind::Other, "unsupported command")),
    }

    try!(cff3000.show_leds(duration));
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    if args.len() < 2 {
        println!("missing parameter: lock, unlock, check");
        std::process::exit(1)
    }

    match execute(args[1].as_str()) {
        Err(err) => println!("{}", err.to_string()),
        Ok(()) => {},
    }
}
```
